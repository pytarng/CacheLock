/**
 * The {@code LockSmith} class is the key distributed lock manager component in CacheLock project.
 * It supports <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> (with <a href="https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis">Jedis</a> lib)
 * , Redis cluster (with <a href="https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis">Jedis</a> lib),
 * and <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>
 * (with <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/spymemcached">spymemcached</a> lib) by default.
 *
 * <p>Other cache server and client libs can be easily supported by <i>create your own custom client and lock classes</i>
 * , which <b>extends</b> abstract {@code CacheClient} and {@code CacheLock} with abstract methods implemented.</p>
 *
 * <p>Distributed lock can be easily acquired through this class, for example:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     LockSmite locker = new LockSmith();
 *     Jedis jedis = jedisPool.getResource();
 *     CacheLock target = new RedisLock("lock_key", jedis);
 *     try {
 *         locker.lock(target);
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *         locker.unlock(target);
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Please make sure that all acquired locks will be unlock after no longer needed. The suggested way is to put the
 * {@code unlock} method call in the <i>finally statement</i>.</p>
